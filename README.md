Vortex is a powerful and robust GUI-based scraper for downloading and automatically organizing videos from Discord channels. Built with Python and Tkinter, it provides a user-friendly interface to manage complex scraping tasks, complete with advanced features like intelligent proxy rotation, self-healing proxy lists, and a fast, scalable SQLite backend.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **User-Friendly GUI:** A simple interface built with Tkinter to manage channels, settings, and monitor progress.
* **Advanced Proxy Management:**
    * Sequential proxy rotation with failover.
    * Differentiates between dead proxies (immediate removal) and slow proxies (5-try rule).
    * The cleaned list of working proxies is automatically saved to `proxies.txt`.
* **Efficient & Resumable Scans:**
    * Uses a "Dual-Ended" scanning method to quickly fetch new videos while efficiently backfilling a channel's history.
    * Automatically marks channels as "complete" to prevent re-scanning.
* **Scalable Backend:**
    * All video metadata is stored in a fast and efficient **SQLite database**.
    * Includes a one-time script to migrate old JSON metadata to the new database.
* **Automatic Categorization:**
    * After downloading, videos are automatically checked and sorted into folders based on whether they contain audio (`With_Audio`, `Without_Audio`) or are corrupt (`Invalid_or_Corrupt`).
* **Beautiful HTML Gallery:**
    * Automatically generates a modern, paginated HTML index of all downloaded videos.
    * Features interactive buttons to filter the gallery by category.
